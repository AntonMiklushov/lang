# What it is

This project was made mostly for learning c++, it is slow and inefficient,
but it does work. (kind of) I would call it some kind of interpreter. Honestly it was
much more complex task than I thought.

# Syntax

Varibale definition: name \[variable name\] \[value\]

If statement: (\[case\]) ? \[{first option}\] : \[{second option}\]

Goto lable:
- lable \[name\]
- goto \[name\]

Function definition: name \[funtion name\] func (\[params\]) {\[function body\]}

Built in functions:
- print(\[variable or name\]), returns what you gave to it
- input(\[variable or name\]), returns variable, containing user's input

# Supported datatypes

You don't have to define or cast types by hand, it is done automatically.

## Types
- integer
- float
- string

## Operations
- numerical addition, substraction, multiplication and division
- addition numerical types with string always leads to string output
- comparing for equality
